# Adolphus - Multi-Camera System Coverage Modeling Suite

## Catherine's fork Overview

I'm in the process of adding [pyglet](http://pyglet.org) as an alternate 3D library

## Overview

Adolphus is a set of tools for modeling and visualizing the coverage of
multi-camera systems.

See our [screencast] [screencast] for an introduction.



## Dependencies

Adolphus requires [Python] [python] 2.6 or later, [PyYAML] [pyyaml] 3.09 or later, [Cython] [cython] 0.14 or later, [pycollada][collada] 0.4 or later, and [setuptools] [setuptools].

[Visual] [visual] 5.4 or later is required for 3D visualization and interaction
(optional, recommended). [PyGTK] [pygtk] 2.22 or later is required for the
interactive tool panel (optional).

[Epydoc] [epydoc] is required for generating API documentation (optional).


## Development

### Cython Modules

After modifying any `.pyx` file, regenerate the C source and build it in-place
for testing by issuing the following commands in the repository root:

    cython adolphus/*.pyx
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
