# Adolphus - Multi-Camera Network Coverage Modeling Suite


## Overview

Adolphus is a set of tools for modeling and visualizing the coverage of
multi-camera networks.


## Requirements

Adolphus requires [Python] [1] 2.6 or later, [Cython] [2] 0.14 or later, and
[PyYAML] [3] 3.09 or later.

The [Visual] [4] module of VPython is required for visualization (optional,
recommended).

[Epydoc] [5] is required for generating API documentation (optional).
